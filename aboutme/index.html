<h2>Carlos Jose Garcia</h2>
<p>Hi everyone!
    My name is Carlos Jose Garcia, but my friends and co-workers usually call me "Carlitos", so you can address me like that if you want to! I'm 27 years old, single, I'm from Venezuela but I'm currently living in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
    I like to study, take long walks by the city of Buenos Aires while I'm listening podcasts or enjoying good music. My favorites music genders are Jazz, Classic Rock and Progressive Rock.
    I like to improve myself constantly, thats why I choose to study Applied Technology at Brigham Young University Idaho. I am a Lawyer with a Master Degree in Commercial Law, but saddly I had to leave my country for the hard social, economic and political situation, in consecuence, I'm not longer practicing my profession, but I'm optimist and very grateful with our Heavenly Father for this big opportunity.
    My friends, please be patient with my English, I'm still learning and I still have some struggles with this beutiful language.
    I hope I can be a great classmate to all of you!
